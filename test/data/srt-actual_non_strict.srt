WOMAN: The great artisans say
the more the teapot is used

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,360
the more beautiful it becomes.

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:27,320
The pot is seasoned by repeatedly
pouring tea over the surface.

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:34,640
The deposit left on the clay creates
this beautiful patina over time.

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,080
Some pots, the clay has been
burnished by tea made
over 400 years ago.

The clay is cracking.

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,200
Well, I can't see how a tiny splash
of tea is going to help.

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,000
Sometimes
you have to look hard at something

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,520
to see its value.

17
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,760
See?

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,960
This one shines a little brighter.

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,040
I don't suppose...

Um, I mean...

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,080
I don't suppose
that you want to have a drink?

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,400
Not tea, obviously.
Um, in a pub, with me, tonight.

Um...?

24
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,640
You wouldn't like me all that much.

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,040
Can I maybe decide that for myself?

26
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,000
I can't.

What? Why not?

53
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,880
Because I had a row in the shop

You had a row with a machine?!

Mine was in the bedroom.

00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,840

We were at uni together, and this guy
here had a trick he used to do.

00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,120
It's not a trick.

98
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,160
He could look at you
and tell you your whole life story.

99
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,600
Yes, I've seen him do it. Put the
wind up everybody, we hated him.

100
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,720
We'd come down to breakfast
in the formal hall

101
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,760
and this freak would know you'd been
shagging the previous night.

102
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,120
I simply observed.
Go on, enlighten me.

103
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,920
Two trips a month,
flying all the way around the world,
you're quite right.

104
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,440
How could you tell? Are you going
to tell me there's a stain on my tie

105
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,920
from some special kind of ketchup
you can only buy in Manhattan?

106
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,400
No, I...
Is it the mud on my shoes?

107
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,400
I was just chatting with
your secretary outside.

108
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,960
She told me.

That door didn't open last night?

126
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,080
There's a hole in our security.

130
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,720
Tell me how he got in.

131
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,240
There's a bigger one on its way.

132
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,440
I don't need an incentive,
Sebastian.

133
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,000
He's, er...
CLEARS THROAT
..he's kidding you, obviously.

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,760
Shall I look after that for him?

135
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,240

Two trips around the world

137
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,560
You didn't ask his secretary,
you said that just to irritate him.

138
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,400
How did you know?
Did you see his watch?

139
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,160
His watch?

140
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,880
The time was right,
but the date was wrong.

141
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,240
Said two days ago. Crossed the date
line twice and he didn't alter it.

142
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,480
Within a month?
How did you get that? New Breitling.

143
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,920
Only came out this February.

144
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,640
OK. So do you think we should
sniff around here for a bit longer?

145
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,640
Got everything I need
to know already, thanks.

146
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,880
That graffiti was a message.

147
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,160
Someone at the bank,
working on the trading floors.

148
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,800
We find the intended recipient
and...

149
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
They'll lead us to the person
who sent it?

150
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Obvious.

151
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,920
Well, there's 300 people up there,
who was it meant for?

152
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,440
Pillars. What?

153
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,520
Pillars and the screens.

154
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,320
Very few places
you could see that graffiti from.

155
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,760
That narrows the field considerably.
And, of course, the message was left

156
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,040
at 11.34 last night.
That tells us a lot.

157
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,880
Does it?
Traders come to work at all hours.

158
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,640
Some trade with Hong Kong
in the middle of the night.

159
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,000
That message was intended for
somebody who came in at midnight.

160
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,760
Not many Van Coons
in the phone book.

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,800
Taxi!

162
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,040
BUZZES

163
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,640
So what do we do now? Sit here
and wait for him to come back?

164
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,600
Just moved in. What?

165
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,880
Floor above, new label.
Could have just replaced it.

166
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
BUZZES

167
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,000
No-one ever does that.
WOMAN: Hello?

168
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,680
Hi, um, I live in the flat just
below you. I don't think we've met.

169
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,280
No, well, er, I've just moved in.

170
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,440
Actually, I've just locked
my keys in my flat.

171
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,840
Do you want me to buzz you in?

172
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,360
Yeah. And can we use your balcony?

173
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,480
What?!

174
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,760
DOOR BUZZES

175
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,840
WATSON: Sherlock?

176
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,800
WATSON: Sherlock, are you OK?

177
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,960
Yeah, any time
you feel like letting me in(!)

178
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,400
Do you think he'd lost a lot of
money?

179
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,600
Suicide is pretty common
among City boys.

180
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,640
We don't know that it was suicide.
Come on.

181
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,760
The door was locked from the inside,
you had to climb down the balcony.

182
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,880
Been away three days
judging by the laundry.

183
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,200
Look at the case, there was
something tightly packed inside it.

184
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,040
Thanks. I'll take your word for it.
Problem?

185
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,680
Yeah, I'm not desperate to root
around some bloke's dirty underwear.

186
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,240
Those symbols at the bank, the
graffiti, why were they put there?

187
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,320
Some sort of code? Obviously.

188
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,720
Why were they painted? Want to
communicate, why not use e-mail?

189
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,320
Well, maybe he wasn't answering.

190
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,840
Oh, good, you follow.

191
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,680
No.

192
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,280
What kind of a message
would everyone try to avoid?

193
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,320
What about this morning?

194
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,800
Those letters you were looking at?
Bills?

195
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,880
Yes. He was being threatened.

196
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,440
MAN'S VOICE IN BACKGROUND

197
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,520
Not by the Gas Board.

198
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,320
DIMMOCK: ...see if we can get prints
off this glass.

199
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,280
Sergeant, we haven't met.

200
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,600
Yeah, I know who you are

201
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,000
and I would prefer it if you didn't
tamper with any of the evidence.

202
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,760
I phoned Lestrade. Is he on his way?
He's busy. I'm in charge.

203
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,600
And it's not Sergeant,
it's Detective Inspector Dimmock.

204
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,240
We're obviously
looking at a suicide.

205
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,840
It does seem the only explanation
of all the facts.

206
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,360
Wrong, it's one possible explanation
of some of the facts.

207
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,760
You've got a solution that you like,
but you are choosing

208
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,800
to ignore anything you see
that doesn't comply with it.

209
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,720
Like? Wound's on the right side of
his head.

210
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,000
And? Van Coon was left-handed.

211
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,440
Requires quite a bit of contortion.

212
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,080
Left-handed? I'm amazed you
didn't notice. All you have to do
is look around this flat.

213
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,000
Coffee table on the left-hand side,

214
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,640
coffee mug handle
pointing to the left.

215
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,080
Power sockets, habitually used
the ones on the left. Pen and paper

216
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,400
on the left of the phone.
Picked up with his right,
took messages with his left.

217
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,200
D'you want me to go on?
No, I think you've covered it.

218
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,960
I might as well, I'm almost
at the bottom of the list.

219
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,680
There's a knife on the breadboard
with butter on the right side
of the blade

220
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,400
because he used it with his left.
It's highly unlikely

221
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,640
that a left-handed man would shoot
himself in the right of his head.

222
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,800
Conclusion, someone broke in here
and murdered him -

223
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,720
only explanation
of all of the facts.

224
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,800
But the gun?
He was waiting for the killer.

225
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,640
He'd been threatened. What?

226
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,520
Today at the bank, sort of a warning.

227
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,560
He fired a shot
when his attacker came in.

228
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,080
And the bullet?
Went through the open window.

229
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,000
Oh, come on(!)

230
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,760
What are the chances of that?!

231
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,000
Wait until you get the ballistics
report.

232
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,800
The bullet in his brain wasn't
fired from his gun, I guarantee it.

233
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,040
If his door was locked from the
inside, how did the killer get in?

234
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,920
Good, you're finally asking
the right questions.

235
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,240
He's left trying to sort of
cut his hair with a fork,

236
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,040
which of course can never be done.

237
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,920
It was a threat,
that's what the graffiti meant.

238
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,080
I'm kind of in a meeting.

239
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,440
Can you make an appointment
with my secretary?

240
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,680
I don't think this can wait.
Sorry, Sebastian.

241
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,680
One of your traders, someone who
worked in your office, was killed.

242
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,480
What? Van Coon.

243
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,560
The police are at his flat.

244
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,440
Killed?!
Sorry to interfere

245
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,640
with everyone's digestion.
Still want to make an appointment(?)

246
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,920
Would maybe nine o'clock
at Scotland Yard suit?

247
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,800
Harrow, Oxford...very bright guy.

248
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,840
Worked in Asia for a while, so...

249
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,520
You gave him the Hong Kong accounts?

250
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,760
Lost 5 million in a single morning,
made it all back a week later.

251
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,360
Nerves of steel, Eddie had.

252
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,760
Who'd want to kill him?
We all make enemies.

253
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,520
You don't all end up with a bullet
through your temple.

254
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,960
MOBILE RINGS
Not usually. Excuse me.

255
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,200
It's my chairman.

256
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,080
Police have been on to him.

257
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,000
Apparently they're telling him

258
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,880
it was a suicide.
Well, they've got it wrong,

259
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,080
Sebastian. He was murdered.

260
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,960
Well, I'm afraid
they don't see it like that.

261
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,200
So? And neither does my boss.

262
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,400
I hired you to do a job.
Don't get sidetracked.

263
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,880
FADING FOOTSTEPS

264
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,320
I thought bankers were all supposed
to be heartless bastards.

265
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,600
HORN BLARES

266
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,320
I need you to get over to Crispians.

267
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,440
Two Ming vases up for auction -
Chenghua.

268
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,640
Will you appraise them? Soo Lin
should go - she's the expert.

269
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,240
Soo Lin has resigned her job.
I need you.

270
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,040
PHONE RINGING

271
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,640
Just locum work.
No, that's fine.

272
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,840
You're, um...
Well, you're a bit over-qualified.

273
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,920
Er, I could always do
with the money.

274
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,440
Well, we've got two
away on holiday this week

275
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,920
and one's just left to have a baby.

276
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,680
It might be a bit mundane for you.

277
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,480
Er, no, mundane is good, sometimes.

278
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,080
Mundane works.

279
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,280
It says here you were a soldier.
And a doctor.

280
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,680
Anything else you can do?

281
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,720
I learned the clarinet at school.

282
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,360
Oh...
LAUGHS
..well, I'll look forward to it.

283
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,120
I said, could you pass me a pen?

284
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,520
What? When?
About an hour ago.

285
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,440
Didn't notice I'd gone out then?

286
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,480
I went to see about a job
at that surgery.

287
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,400
How was it?
Great. She's great.

288
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,360
Who?

289
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,640
The job.

290
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,720
She?!

291
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,840
It.

292
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,160
Yeah, have a look.

293
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,400
"The intruder
who can walk through walls."

294
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,520
It happened last night.

295
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,800
Journalist shot dead in his flat.

296
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,680
Doors locked,
windows bolted from the inside.

297
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,440
Exactly the same as Van Coon.

298
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,480
God! You think...?
He's killed another one.

299
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,520
Brian Lukis,
freelance journalist,

300
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,880
murdered in his flat.

301
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,920
Doors locked from the inside.

302
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,080
You've got to admit,
it's similar.

303
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,400
Both men killed by someone
who can walk through solid walls.

304
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,120
Inspector, do you seriously believe
that Eddie Van Coon was

305
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,520
just another city suicide?

306
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,800
SIGHS
You have seen
the ballistics report, I suppose?

307
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,160
And the shot that killed him.
Was it fired from his own gun?

308
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,560
No. No.
So this investigation might move

309
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,200
a bit quicker if you were
to take my word as gospel.

310
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,840
I've just handed you
a murder inquiry.

311
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,040
Five minutes in his flat.

312
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,200
Four floors up.

313
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,960
That's why they think they're safe.

314
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,080
Put a chain across the door,
bolt it shut, think they're
impregnable.

315
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,040
They don't reckon for one second
that there's another way in.

316
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,960
I don't understand. Dealing
with a killer who can climb.

317
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,200
What are you doing?
Clings to the walls like an insect.

318
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,280
CLUNK!
That's how he got in.

319
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,280
What?!

320
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,360
He climbed up the side of the walls,
ran along the roof,

321
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,320
dropped in through this skylight.

322
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,400
You're not serious?! Like Spider-Man?

323
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,720
He scaled six floors of a Docklands
apartment building,

324
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,240
jumped the balcony and killed
Van Coon. Oh, hold on(!)

325
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,720
That's how he got into the bank -
ran along the window ledge
onto the terrace.

326
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,200
I have to find out
what connects these two men.

327
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,280
Date stamped on the book
is the same day that he died.

328
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,680
Sherlock?

329
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,520
So, the killer goes to the bank,

330
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,640
leaves a threatening cipher
at the bank.

331
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,400
Van Coon panics, returns
to his apartment, locks himself in.

332
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,440
Hours later, he dies.

333
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,320
The killer finds Lukis at the
library, he writes the cipher

334
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,920
on the shelf where he knows
it'll be seen. Lukis goes home.

335
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,120
Late that night, he dies too.

336
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,920
Why did they die, Sherlock?

337
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,920
Only the cipher can tell us.

338
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,160
The world's run on
codes and ciphers, John.

339
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,800
From the million-pound
security system at the bank
to the PIN machine

340
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,000
you took exception to. Cryptography
inhabits our every waking moment.

341
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,560
Yes, OK, but...

342
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,320
But it's all computer generated -

343
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,840
electronic codes,
electronic ciphering methods.

344
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,640
This is different.

345
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,760
It's an ancient device.

346
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,120
Modern code-breaking methods
won't unravel it.

347
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,000
Where are we headed?
I need to ask some advice.

348
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,400
What?! Sorry?

349
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,920
You heard me perfectly.
I'm not saying it again.

350
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,640
You need advice?
On painting.

351
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,360
Yes, I need to talk to an expert.

352
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,280
SIREN WAILS

353
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,120
Part of a new exhibition.

354
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,960
Interesting.
I call it...

355
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,400
Urban Bloodlust Frenzy.
CHUCKLES

356
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,280
Catchy(!)

357
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,080
I've got two minutes before
a Community Support Officer

358
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,360
comes around that corner.

359
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,920
Can we do this while I'm working?

360
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,240
Know the author?
I recognise the paint.

361
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,960
It's like Michigan...hard-core
propellant.

362
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,160
I'd say zinc.

363
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,680
And what about the symbols?
Do you recognise them?

364
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,840
I'm not even sure
it's a proper language.

365
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,120
Two men have been murdered, Raz.

366
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,240
Deciphering this is the key
to finding out who killed them.

367
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,160
And this is all you've
got to go on(?)

368
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,960
It's hardly much, is it?
Are you going to help us or not?

369
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,600
I'll ask around.

370
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,080
Somebody must know something
about it. Oi!

371
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,280
METALLIC CLATTERING

372
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,160
What the hell do you think you're
doing? This gallery is a listed
public building.

373
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,520
No, no. Wait, wait.
It's not me who painted that.

374
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,000
I was just holding this for...

375
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,280
Bit of an enthusiast, are we?

376
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,920
POLICE RADIO IN BACKGROUND

377
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,560
She was right in the middle of
an important piece of restoration.

378
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,480
Why would she suddenly resign?

379
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,560
Family problems.
She said so in her letter.

380
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,560
But she doesn't have a family.
She came to this country on her own.

381
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,000
Andy! Look, those teapots,
those ceramics.

382
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,800
They've become her obsession.

383
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,280
She's been working on restoring them
for weeks.

384
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,760
I can't believe
that she would just...abandon them.

385
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,000
Perhaps she was getting
a bit of unwanted attention?

386
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,640
DOOR SLAMS

387
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,360
You've been a while.

388
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,800
Yeah, well, you know how it is.

389
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,840
Custody sergeants don't really
like to be hurried, do they?

390
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,360
Just formalities. Fingerprints,

391
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,960
charge sheet, and I've got to be
in magistrates' court on Tuesday.

392
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,040
What? Me, Sherlock!
In court, on Tuesday!

393
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,680
They're giving me an ASBO!
Good, fine.

394
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,040
You want to tell your little pal
he's welcome to go and own up
any time.

395
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,280
This symbol, I still can't place it.

396
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,920
No, I need you to go
to the police station

397
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,120
and ask about the journalist.
The personal effects
will have been impounded.

398
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,440
Get hold of his diary, or something
that will tell us his movements.

399
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,160
Go and see Van Coon's PA.

400
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,720
If you retrace their steps,
somewhere they'll coincide.

401
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,080
SHUTTER CLICKS

402
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,280
Scotland Yard.

403
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
Flew back from Dalian Friday.

404
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,120
Looks like he had back-to-back
meetings with the sales team.

405
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,600
Can you print me up a copy?

406
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,640
Sure.
What about the day he died?

407
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,680
Can you tell me where he was?
Sorry, I've got a gap.

408
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,520
I have all his receipts.

409
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Your friend...
Listen, whatever you say,

410
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,120
I'm behind you 100 per cent.

411
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,600
...he's an arrogant sod.

412
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,000
Well, that was mild.
People say a lot worse than that.

413
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,520
This is what you wanted, isn't it?
The journalist's diary?

414
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,480
What kind of a boss was he, Amanda?
Appreciative?

415
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,040
Um, no. That's not a word I'd use.

416
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,800
The only things Eddie appreciated
had a big price tag.

417
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,520
Like that hand cream.
He bought that for you, didn't he?

418
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,600
Look at this one.

419
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,000
Got a taxi from him
on the day he died, 

420
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,840
That would get him to the office.

421
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,560
Not rush hour. Check the time.
Mid-morning. 18 would get him

422
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,920
as far as... ..The West End.
I remember him saying.

423
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,040
Underground,
printed at one in Piccadilly.

424
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,000
So he got a Tube back to the office.

425
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,400
Why would he get a taxi into town,
and then the Tube back?

426
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,640
Because he was delivering
something heavy.

427
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,520
You wouldn't lug a package
up the escalator.

428
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,440
Delivering?!

429
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
To somewhere near
Piccadilly Station.

430
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,760
Dropped the package,
delivered it, and then...

431
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,000
Stopped on his way. He got peckish.

432
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,600
So you bought your lunch
from here en route to the station

433
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,240
but where were you headed from?

434
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,160
Where did the taxi drop you?

435
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,880
Oof! Right.

436
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,840
Eddie Van Coon brought a package
here the day he died.

437
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,320
Whatever was hidden inside
that case...

438
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,280
I've managed to piece
together a picture

439
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,800
using scraps of information -
credit card bills, receipts.
He flew back from China,

440
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,320
then he came here. Sherlock.

441
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,680
Somewhere in this street, somewhere
near. I don't know where, but...

442
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,800
That shop, over there.
How could you tell?

443
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,160
Lukis' diary. He was here too.

444
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,360
He wrote down the address. Oh.

445
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,320
SHOP BELL RINGS

446
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,360
Hello.

447
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,800
You want...lucky cat?

448
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,440
No, thanks, no.

449
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,200


450
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,480
I think your wife, she will like.

451
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,480
Um, thank you.

452
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,640
Sherlock...

453
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,800
The label there.
Yes, I see it.

454
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,400
It's exactly the same as the cipher.

455
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,240
WATSON CLEARS THROAT

456
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,120
It's an ancient number system -
Hang Zhou.

457
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,480
These days only street traders
use it.

458
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,640
Those were numbers written on the
wall at the bank and at the library.

459
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,720
Numbers written in
an ancient Chinese dialect.

460
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,400
It's a 15.

461
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,520
What we thought was the
artist's tag, it's a number 15.

462
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,480
And the blindfold, the horizontal
line. That was a number as well.

463
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,880
The Chinese number one, John.
We found it.

464
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,800
Two men travel back from China,

465
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,440
both head straight for
the Lucky Cat emporium.

466
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,640
What did they see?

467
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,720
It's not what they saw.

468
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,080
It's what they both brought back
in those suitcases.

469
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,240
And you don't mean duty free.

470
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,600
Thank you.

471
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,000
Think about what Sebastian told us.

472
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,720
About Van Coon, about
how he stayed afloat in the market.

473
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,640
Lost 5 million.
Made it back in a week.

474
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,480
That's how he made such easy money.

475
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,240
He was a smuggler. Mm.

476
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,040
Cover would have been perfect.

477
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,360
Businessman,
making frequent trips to Asia.

478
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,560
Lukis was the same,
a journalist writing about China.

479
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,000
Both of them smuggled stuff about.

480
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,280
The Lucky Cat was their drop-off.

481
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,440
But why did they die?

482
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,120
It doesn't make sense.
If they both turn up at the shop
and deliver the goods,

483
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,800
why would someone threaten them

484
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,040
and kill them after the event,
after they'd finished the job?

485
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,160
What if one of them
was light-fingered?

486
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,120
How do you mean? Stole something.

487
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,640
Something from the hoard.

488
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,640
The killer doesn't know
which of them took it

489
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,120
so threatens them both. Right.

490
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,720
Remind me.

491
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,320
When was the last time
that it rained?

492
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,160
It's been here since Monday.

493
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,760
HE RINGS DOORBELL

494
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,920
No-one's been in that flat
for at least three days.

495
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,960
Could have gone on holiday.

496
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,760
Do you leave your windows open
when you go on holiday?

497
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,760
METALLIC SCREECH

00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,840
Someone else has been here.

501
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,480
Somebody else broke into the flat
and knocked over the vase,
just like I did.

502
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,480
SNIFFS
DOORBELL RINGS

503
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,520
Do you think maybe
you could let me in this time?

504
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,720
Can you not keep doing this, please?

505
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,880
I'm not the first.

506
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,920
What?
Somebody's been in here before me.

507
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,520
What are you saying?

508
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,040
Size eight feet.

509
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,800
Small, but...athletic.

510
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,600
I'm wasting my breath.

Small, strong hands.

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,440
Our acrobat.

514
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,360
Why didn't he close the window
when he lef...?

515
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,280
Oh, stupid, stupid!

516
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
Obvious.

517
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,880
He's still here.

John...

521
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,440
John!

522
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,160
Oh, I'm Sherlock Holmes
and I always work alone

523
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,160
because no-one else can compete
with my massive intellect(!)

GROANS

527
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,880
The milk's gone off
and the washing's started to smell.

528
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,760
Somebody left here in a hurry
three days ago. Somebody?

529
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,480
Soo Lin Yao. We have to find her.

530
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,200
How, exactly?

531
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,080
We could start with this.

532
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,080
You've gone all croaky.
Are you getting a cold?

533
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,720
COUGHS
I'm fine.

534
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,440
When was the last time
that you saw her?

535
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,960
ANDY: Three days ago.
Here at the museum.

536
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,920
This morning they told me
she'd resigned.

537
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,480
Just like that.
Left her work unfinished.

538
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,360
What was the last thing that she did
on her final afternoon?

539
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,680
She does this demonstration
for the tourists, a tea ceremony.

540
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,280
So she would have packed up her
things and just put them in here.

541
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,480
We have to get to Soo Lin Yao.

542
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,800
If she's still alive.
Sherlock!

543
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,440
Oh, look who it is.

544
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,880
Found something you'll like.

545
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
Tuesday morning,

546
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,360
all you've got to do is turn up
and say the bag was yours.

547
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,960
Forget about your court date.

548
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,480
GIRL: Dude, that was rad!

549
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,960
You want to hide a tree, then a
forest is the best place to do it,

550
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,640
wouldn't you say?

551
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,320
People would just walk
straight past, not knowing,

552
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,120
unable to decipher the message.

553
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,400
There. I spotted it earlier.

554
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,280
They've been here.
And that's the exact same paint?

555
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,280
Yeah.

556
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,520
John, if we're going to
decipher this code,

557
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,200
we need to look for more evidence.

558
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,080
Answer your phone.
I've been calling you.

559
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,840
PANTING
I found it.

560
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,600
It's been painted over.

561
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,320
I don't understand. It was...

562
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,440
here.

563
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,000
10 minutes ago. I saw it.

564
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,760
A whole load of graffiti.

565
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,840
Somebody doesn't want me to see it.

566
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,120
Sherlock, what are you doing...?
Ssh! John, concentrate.

567
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,960
I need you to concentrate.
Close your eyes.

568
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,480
What? Why? Why? What are you doing?

569
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,160
I need you to maximise
your visual memory.

570
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,120
Try to picture what you saw.

571
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,240
Can you picture it? Yeah.

572
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,000
Can you remember it?
Yes, definitely.

573
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,080
Can you remember the pattern?

574
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,800
Yes. How much can you remember it?

575
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,960
Look, don't worry.

576
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,400
Because the average human memory
on visual matters
is only 62% accurate.

577
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,680
Well, don't worry,
I remember all of it. Really?

578
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,120
At least I would, if I could get
to my pockets. I took a photograph.

579
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,920
MOBILE BEEPS

580
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,320
TRAIN RUMBLES

581
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,120
Always in pairs, John, look.

582
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,840
Numbers...

583
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,720
come with partners.

584
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,120
God, I need to sleep.

585
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,240
Why did he paint it
so near the tracks? No idea.

586
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,320
Thousands of people
pass by there every day.

587
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,320
Just 20 minutes...

588
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,320
Of course.

589
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,640
Of course, he wants information.
He's trying to communicate

590
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,880
with his people in the underworld.
Whatever was stolen,
he wants it back.

591
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,520
It's somewhere here, in a code.

592
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,800
We can't crack this
without Soo Lin Yao.

593
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,760
Oh, good.

594
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,520
Two men who travelled back
from China were murdered.

595
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,640
And their killer left them messages
in Hang Zhou numerals.

596
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,640
Soo Lin Yao is in danger.

597
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,520
That cipher, it was just
the same pattern as the others.

598
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,280
He means to kill her as well.

599
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,200
Look, I've tried everywhere -

600
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,800
friends, colleagues.
I don't know where she's gone.

601
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,120
I mean, she could be
a thousand miles away.

602
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,280
What are you looking at?
Tell me more about those teapots.

603
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,800
The pots were her obsession.
They need urgent work.

604
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,160
If they dry out,
then the clay can start to crumble.

605
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,280
Apparently, you have to just
keep making tea in them.

606
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,120
Yesterday, only one of those pots
was shining.

607
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,840
Now, there are two.

608
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,560
GRATING

609
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,960
Fancy a biscuit with that?

610
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,960
Centuries old.
Don't want to break that.

611
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,480
Hello.

612
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,280
You saw the cipher.

613
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,880
Then you know he is coming for me.

614
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,440
You've been clever
to avoid him so far.

615
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,680
I had to finish.

616
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,560
To finish this work.

617
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,640
It's only a matter of time.

618
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,200
I know he will find me.

619
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,120
Who is he?
Have you met him before?

620
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,200
When I was a girl, we met in China.

621
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,640
I recognised his...

622
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,000
signature.
The cipher?

623
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,200
Only he would do this. Zhi Zhu.

624
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,760
Zhi Zhu? The spider.

625
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,360
You know this mark?

626
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,480
Yes. It's the mark of a Tong.

627
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,080
Huh? Ancient crime syndicate,
based in China.

628
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,080
Every foot soldier bears the mark.

629
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,400
Everyone who hauls for them.

630
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,320
Hauls?

631
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,840
You mean you were a smuggler?

632
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,840
I was 15.

633
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,440
My parents were dead.

634
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,480
I had no livelihood.

635
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,200
No way of surviving, day-to-day,

636
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,200
except to work for the bosses.

637
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,000
Who are they?

638
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,040
They are called the Black Lotus.

639
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,400
By the time I was 16,

640
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,560
I was taking
thousands of pounds worth of drugs

641
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,480
across the border into Hong Kong.

642
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,360
I managed to leave
that life behind me.

643
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,160
I came to England.

644
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,080
They gave me a job, here.

645
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,920
Everything was good. New life.

646
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,720
And he came looking for you.

647
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,200
Yes.

648
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,440
I hoped, after five years...

649
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,560
maybe they would have forgotten me.

650
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,440
But they never really let you leave.

651
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,040
A small community like ours...

652
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,560
..they are never very far away.

653
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,640
He came to my flat.

654
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:26,280
He asked me to help him to track down
something that was stolen.

655
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,200
And you've no idea what it was?

656
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,480
I refused to help.

657
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,800
So, you knew him well
when you were living back in China?

658
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,560
Oh, yes.

659
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,200
He's my brother.

660
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,360
Two orphans.

661
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,240
We had no choice.

662
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:09,600
We could work for the Black Lotus,
or starve on the streets, like
beggars.

663
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,720
My brother has become their puppet.

664
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:22,400
In the power of the one
they call Shan.

665
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,160
The Black Lotus general.

666
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,800
I turned my brother away.

667
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,520
He said I had betrayed him.

668
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,480
Next day, I came to work

669
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,880
and the cipher was waiting.

670
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,080
Can you decipher these?

671
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,520
These are numbers. Yes, I know.

672
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:59,840
Here, the line across the man's
eyes, it's the Chinese number one.

673
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,600
And this one is 15.
But what's the code?

674
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,160
All the smugglers know it.

675
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,840
It's based upon a book...

676
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,840
DOOR THUDS

677
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,320
He's here.

678
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,840
Zhi Zhu has found me.

679
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,120
No, no, Sherlock.

680
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,160
Sherlock, wait!

681
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,000
Come here.

682
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,960
Get in. Get in!

683
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,840
GUNSHOT

684
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,920
SECOND GUNSHOT

685
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,800
MORE GUNSHOTS

686
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,320
I have to go and help him.
Bolt the door after me.

687
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,400
GUNSHOT

688
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,920
GUNSHOTS

689
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,200
Careful!
GUNSHOT

690
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,560
Some of those skulls are over
200,000 years old.
Have a bit of respect.

691
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,400
Thank you.

692
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,400
Liang.

693
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,320
SPEAKS CHINESE

694
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,440
SPEAKS CHINESE

695
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,280
GUNSHOT

696
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,040
Oh, my God.

697
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,520
GULPS

698
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,120
How many murders is it going to take

699
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,840
before you start believing
that this maniac's out there?

700
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,560
MUTTERS

701
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,960
A young girl was gunned down
tonight.

702
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,800
That's three victims in three days.
You're supposed to be finding him.

703
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,160
Brian Lukis and Eddie Van Coon

704
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,520
were working for a gang
of international smugglers.

705
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,080
A gang called the Black Lotus,
operating here in London

706
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,320
right under your nose.

707
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,720
Can you prove that?

708
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,320
What are you thinking?
Pork or pasta? Oh, it's you.

709
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,360
I suppose it's never going
to trouble Egon Ronay, is it?

710
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,920
I'd stick with the pasta.

711
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,200
Don't want to be doing roast pork,
not if you're slicing up cadavers.

712
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,560
What are you having?

713
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,000
I don't eat when I'm working.
Digesting slows me down.

714
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,880
So you're working here tonight?

715
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,720
Need to examine some bodies. Some?

716
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,520
Eddie Van Coon and Brian Lukis.

717
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,080
They're on my list.

718
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,960
Could you wheel them out again
for me?

719
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,200
Well...their paperwork's
already gone through.

720
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,960
You changed your hair. What?

721
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,560
The style.
It's usually parted in the middle.

722
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,160
Yes, well...

723
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,400
It's good.

724
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,800
It...suits you better this way.

725
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,520
We're just interested in the feet.

726
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,320
The feet? Yes.

727
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,120
Do you mind if we have
a look at them?

728
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,480
Now, Van Coon.

729
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,800
Oh! So...

730
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,120
So either these two men just
happened to visit the same
Chinese tattoo parlour,

731
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,560
or I'm telling the truth.
What do you want?

732
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,080
I want every book from Lukis'
apartment and Van Coon's.

733
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,320
Their books?

734
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,240
Not just a criminal organisation.
It's a cult.

735
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,720
Her brother was corrupted
by one of its leaders.

736
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,160
Soo Lin said the name.

737
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,920
Yes, Shan. General Shan.

738
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,600
We're still no closer to finding him.

739
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,920
Wrong! We've got almost
all we need to know.

740
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,000
She gave us most of
the missing pieces.

741
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,600
Why did he need to visit his sister?

742
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,160
Why did he need her expertise?
She worked at the museum.

743
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,360
Exactly. An expert in antiquities.

744
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,920
Of course, I see.
Valuable antiquities, John.

745
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,760
Ancient Chinese relics
purchased on the black market.

746
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,000
China's home to a thousand treasures
hidden after Mao's revolution.

747
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,440
The Black Lotus is selling them.

748
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,960
Check for the dates... Here,

749
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,600
John,
"arrived from China four days ago".

750
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,160
Anonymous.

751
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,640
The vendor doesn't give his name.

752
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,120
"Two undiscovered treasures
from the East."

753
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:26,640
One in Lukis' suitcase
and one in Van Coon's.

754
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,120
"Antiquities...

755
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,920
"sold at auction."

756
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,280
Look, here's another one.

757
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,000
Arrived from China a month ago,

758
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,440
Chinese ceramic statue sold for


759
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,840
Look, a month before that,
Chinese painting, 

760
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,160
All of them
from an anonymous source.

761
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,120
They're stealing them back in China
and one by one feeding them
into Britain.

762
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,560
Every single auction coincides
with Lukis or Van Coon
travelling to China.

763
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,720
So what if one of them got greedy
when they were in China?

764
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,280
What if one of them stole something?

765
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,600
That's why Zhi Zhu's come.
KNOCK AT DOOR

766
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,760
Sorry, are we collecting
for charity, Sherlock?

767
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,920
What?

768
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,800
A young man's outside
with crates of books.

769
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,360
So the numbers are references.

770
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,760
To books.

771
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,160
To specific pages
and specific words on those pages.

772
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,440
Right, so...

773
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,560
15 and 1, that means?

774
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,760
Turn to page 15
and it's the first word you read.

775
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,160
OK, so what's the message?
Depends on the book.

776
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,080
That's the cunning of the book code.

777
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,040
It has to be one that they both own.

778
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:43,840
OK, fine. This shouldn't take
too long, should it(?)

779
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,600
We found these...at the museum.
Is this your writing?

780
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:04,200
Er, we hoped Soo Lin
could decipher it for us.

781
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,160
Ta.

782
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,720
Anything else I can do?

783
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,880
To assist you, I mean.

784
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,240
Some silence right now
would be marvellous.

785
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,280
Cigarette.

786
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,280
Imagine.

787
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,800
CLOCK TICKS

788
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,720
WATCH BLEEPS

789
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,160
Oh...

790
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,760
CHURCH BELLS RING

791
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,680
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,

792
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,480
but we haven't got anything now
until next Thursday.

793
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,320
WOMAN: This is taking ages.

794
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,680
Sorry.

795
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,040
WOMAN: What's the point of booking
an appointment if they
can't stick to it?

796
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,680
Um, what's going on?

797
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:39,840
That new doctor you hired, he
hasn't buzzed the intercom for ages.

798
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,600
Let me go and have a word.

799
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,440
Excuse me. Sorry.

800
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,960
KNOCKS ON DOOR
John?

801
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,240
John?

802
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,400
GENTLE SNORING

803
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,560
Looks like I'm done.
I thought I had some more to see.

804
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,640
Oh, I did one or two of yours.
One or two?

805
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,920
Well, maybe five or six.

806
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,280
I'm sorry,
that's not very professional.

807
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,920
No, not really.

808
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,400
I had...a bit of a late one.

809
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,160
Oh, right.

810
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,600
Anyway, see you.

811
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:31,480
So...what were you doing
to keep you up so late?

812
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,440
I was attending
a sort of book event.

813
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,600
Oh. Oh, she likes books,
does she, your girlfriend?

814
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,480
No, it wasn't a date.

815
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:44,480
Good. I mean, I'm...
And I don't have one tonight.

816
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,400
A book that everybody would own.

817
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,280
15, entry 1.

818
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,560
I need to get some air.
We're going out tonight.

819
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,680
Actually, I've got a date. What?

820
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,840
Where two people who like each other
go out and have fun?

821
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,480
That's what I was suggesting.

822
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,480
No, it wasn't. At least, I hope not.

823
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,080
Where are you taking her?

824
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,640
Er, cinema.

825
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,640
Dull, boring, predictable...

826
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,920
Why don't you try this?

827
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,800
In London for one night only.

828
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,320
LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

829
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,440
Thanks, but I don't come to you
for dating advice.

830
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,640
SARAH: It's years since anyone
took me to the circus.

831
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,880
Right, yes.

832
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:51,000
A friend recommended it to me
and I phoned up.

833
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,080
Oh! What are they,
a touring company or something?

834
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,800
I don't know much about it.

835
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,680
I think they're probably from China.

836
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:01,040
I think so, yes.
There's a coincidence(!)

837
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,440
That's wonderful,
thank you very much.

838
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,600
Hi, I have two tickets
reserved for tonight.

839
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,800
And what's the name? Holmes.

840
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,560
Actually, I have three in that name.

841
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,080
No, I don't think so,
we only booked two.

842
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,640
Then I phoned back
and got one for myself as well.

843
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,720
I'm Sherlock.

844
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,600
Hi. Hello.

845
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,600
You couldn't let me have
just one night off.

846
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,120
Yellow Dragon Circus,
in London for one day. It fits.

847
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,840
The Tong sent an assassin
to England...

848
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,120
Dressed as a tightrope walker.
Come on, Sherlock, behave!

849
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,200
We're looking for a killer who can
climb, who can shin up a rope.

850
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,920
Where else would you find
that level of dexterity?

851
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,200
Exit visas are scarce in China.

852
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,120
They need a good reason
to get out of that country.

853
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,920
All I need to do
is have a quick look around...

854
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,720
Fine. You do that,
I'll take Sarah for a pint.

855
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,000
I need your help.

856
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,760
I do have a couple of other things
on my mind this evening.

857
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,000
Like what?

858
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,040
You are kidding?
What's so important?

859
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,880
Sherlock,
I'm in the middle of a date.

860
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,880
You're going to chase some killer
while I'm trying to...

861
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,960
What?

862
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,080
While I'm trying to get off
with Sarah.

863
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,720
Hey... Ready?

864
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,200
Yeah.

865
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,440
MURMUR OF CONVERSATION

866
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,640
You said circus.
This is not a circus.

867
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,080
Look at the size of this crowd.

868
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,560
Sherlock, this is...art.

869
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,160
This is not their day job.

870
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:37,640
Sorry, I forgot, they're not
a circus, they're a gang
of international smugglers.

871
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,720
LOUDER DRUM BEAT

872
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,760
WHOOSH
AUDIENCE GASPS

873
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,960
APPLAUSE

874
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,840
Classic Chinese escapology act.

875
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:16,040
Hm?
The crossbow's on a delicate string.

876
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:19,320
The warrior has to escape his bonds
before it fires.

877
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:27,640
HE SHOUTS

878
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,080
DRUM BEAT QUICKENS

879
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,120
GONG
Oh!

880
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,000
THEY LAUGH

881
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,200
She splits the sandbag,
the sand pours out.

882
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,080
Gradually,
the weight lowers into the bowl.

883
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,960
ESCAPOLOGIST SHOUTS AND STRAINS

884
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:39,920
APPLAUSE

885
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,880
Thank God. My God!

886
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,120
APPLAUSE RESTARTS

887
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,800
Ladies and gentlemen.

888
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:20,440
From the distant moonlit shores
of the Yangtze River,

889
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:23,520
we present, for your pleasure,

890
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,800
the deadly Chinese bird spider.

891
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,080
APPLAUSE

892
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,240
Did you see that?

893
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,280
Well, well.

894
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,240
DOOR OPENS

895
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,760
COAT HANGERS RATTLE

896
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,560
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

897
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,520
Found you.

898
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,760
Come on.
Come on. Let's go!

899
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:45,640
I sent a couple of cars.
The old hall is totally deserted.

900
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:49,000
Look, I saw the mark at the circus.
The tattoo that we saw

901
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,840
on the two bodies,
the mark of the Tong.

902
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:54,360
Lukis and Van Coon were part of
a smuggling operation.

903
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,880
One of them stole something
in China. Something valuable.

904
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,040
The circus performers
were gang members

905
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,200
sent here to get it back.
Get what back?

906
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,120
We don't know.

907
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,800
You don't know?

908
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,840
Mr Holmes,
I've done everything you asked.

909
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:13,640
Lestrade, he seems to think
your advice is worth something.

910
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:14,920
I gave the order for a raid.

911
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,120
Please tell me I'll have something
to show for it.

912
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,960
Other than a massive bill
for overtime.

913
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,240
They'll be back in China by tomorrow.

914
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,920
No, they won't leave
without what they came for.

915
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,840
We need to find a hideout.

916
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,360
A rendezvous.

917
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,640
Somewhere in this message
it must tell us.

918
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,120
Well, I think
perhaps I should leave you to it.

919
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,600
No, you don't have to go. Stay.
Yes, it'd be better if you left now.

920
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,160
He's kidding.
Please stay if you'd like.

921
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,200
Is it just me
or is anyone else starving?

922
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,640
Oh, God.

923
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,120
So this is what you do.

924
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,960
You and John,
you solve puzzles for a living.

925
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,400
Consulting detective.

926
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,440
Oh.

927
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,040
Oh!

928
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,360
What are these squiggles?

929
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,360
They're numbers.
An ancient Chinese dialect.

930
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:31,680
Oh, right. Well, of course
I should have known that.

931
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:40,760
(I've done punch
and a bowl of nibbles.)

932
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,680
Mrs Hudson, you are a saint.

933
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:45,080
If it was Monday,
I'd have been to the supermarket.

934
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,640
Thank you. Thank you.

935
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,480
SIRENS PASS BY

936
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,400
So these numbers, it's a cipher?
Exactly.

937
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,800
And each pair of numbers is a word?

938
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,800
How did you know that?

939
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,520
Well, two words
have already been translated. Here.

940
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,320
John. Mmm?

941
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,320
John, look at this.

942
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,760
Soo Lin at the museum, she started
to translate the code for us.

943
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,440
We didn't see it.

944
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,520
Nine mill.

945
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:21,960
Does that mean millions?

946
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,000
Nine million quid. For what?

947
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,120
We need to know
the end of this sentence.

948
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,680
Where are you going?

949
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:33,480
To the museum, to the restoration
room. We must have been
staring right at it. At what?

950
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,400
The book, John. The book.
The key to cracking the cipher.

951
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:39,520
Soo Lin used it to do this. Whilst
we were running around the gallery,

952
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,040
she started to translate the code.
It must be on her desk.

953
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,200
Taxi!

954
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,640
ANGRY VOICE

955
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,320
Entschuldigen Sie, bitte.

956
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,320
Ja, danke(!)

957
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,080
THEY MUTTER

958
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,480
INAUDIBLE

959
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:17,280
A book that everybody would own.

960
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,080
Please, wait!

961
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,760
Bitte!

962
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,840
Was wollt er?

963
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,480
Hey, du, was machst du?

964
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,680
Minute!
Gib mir doch mein Buch zuruck!

965
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,000
Yeah. No, absolutely.

966
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,040
I mean, a quiet night in
is just what the doctor ordered.

967
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:45,960
I mean, I love to go out of an
evening and wrestle a few Chinese
gangsters generally,

968
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,080
but a girl can get too much. OK.

969
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:54,360
Er, shall we get a takeaway?

970
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,920
Yeah.

971
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,120
Page 15, entry 1...

972
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,200
Page 15, entry 1.

973
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,240
Dead man.

974
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,960
You were threatening to kill them.

975
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,680
That's the first cipher.

976
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,400
9... 0... 15...

977
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,840
er, 15 and 36.

978
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,040
36, 39, 39...

979
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,800
39...

980
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,280
9...

981
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:33,160
"Nine", "mill", "for"...

982
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,840
KNOCK AT DOOR

983
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,200
Blimey, that was quick.
I'll just pop down.

984
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,840
Do you want me to lay the table?

985
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:51,920
Um...eat off trays? Yeah.

986
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,720
70...35...

987
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,360
Jade...

988
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,320
Jade.

989
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,840
Sorry to keep you.
How much do you want?

990
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,520
Do you have it? What?

991
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:13,080
Do you have the treasure?
I don't understand.

992
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,800
MUTTERS

993
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:30,720

HOLMES: John! John, I've got it.

998
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,480
The cipher, the book. It's the
London A-Z that they're us...

999
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:12,560
WOMAN: A book is like
a magic garden,

1000
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,960
carried in your pocket.

1001
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,920
Chinese proverb, Mr Holmes.
I'm...

1002
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,480
I'm not Sherlock Holmes.

1003
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,000
Forgive me
if I do not take your word for it.

1004
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,480
Ow!

1005
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,680
Debit card, name of...

1006
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,840
S Holmes.

1007
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,960
Take my card.

1008
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,080
Yes, that's not actually mine.
He lent that to me.

1009
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:57,040
And a cheque for 
in the name of Mr Sherlock Holmes.

1010
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,480
Yeah, he gave me that to look after.

1011
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:04,480
Tickets from the theatre
collected by you, name of Holmes.

1012
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,720
Yes, OK.

1013
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,160
What's the name?
Er, Holmes.

1014
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,000
I realise what this looks like.

1015
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,640
But I'm not him.

1016
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:14,280
We heard it from your own mouth.
What?

1017
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:18,360
"I am Sherlock Holmes
and I always work alone."

1018
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:21,400
Because no-one else can compete with
my massive intellect.

1019
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,560
Did I really say that?

1020
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:31,720
I suppose there's no use me trying
to persuade you I was doing
an impression.

1021
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,200
I am Shan.

1022
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,960
You're... You're Shan?

1023
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:43,360
Three times we tried to kill you
and your companion, Mr Holmes.

1024
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:47,000
What does it tell you when an
assassin cannot shoot straight?

1025
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,600
GUN COCKS

1026
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,000
GUN CLICKS

1027
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,320
It tells you
that they're not really trying.

1028
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,720
Tramway.

1029
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,840
There.

1030
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:34,120
Not blank bullets now. OK.

1031
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,160
If we wanted to kill you, Mr Holmes,
we would have done it by now.

1032
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,960
We just wanted to
make you inquisitive.

1033
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,840
Do you have it?
Do I have what?

1034
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:48,360
The treasure. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1035
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:51,440
I would prefer to make certain.

1036
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:59,080
Everything in the West
has its price.

1037
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:03,960
And the price for her life -
information.

1038
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,080
SARAH GROANS

1039
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:13,280
(I'm sorry. I'm sorry.)

1040
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:30,520
Where's the hairpin? What?

1041
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:34,440
The Empress pin
valued at 

1042
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,720
We already had a buyer in the West

1043
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,960
and then one of our people
was greedy, he took it,

1044
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,240
brought it back to London, and you,
Mr Holmes, have been searching.

1045
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:45,520
Please, please. Listen to me.
I'm not...

1046
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,840
I'm not Sherlock Holmes.
You have to believe me.

1047
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,680
I haven't found whatever it is
you're looking for.

1048
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:54,800
I need a volunteer from
the audience. No, please, please!

1049
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,320
Ah, thank you, lady.

1050
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:01,480
Yes, you'll do very nicely.

1051
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,480
MUFFLED GROANS

1052
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:29,960
Ladies and gentlemen, from the
distant, moonlit shores of NW1,

1053
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:33,640
we present for your pleasure,

1054
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:39,680
Sherlock Holmes' pretty companion
in a death-defying act. Please!

1055
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,520
You've seen the act before.
How dull for you.

1056
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,080
You know how it ends.

1057
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,000
I'm not Sherlock Holmes!

1058
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,520
I don't believe you.

1059
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,440
You should, you know.

1060
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:57,480
Sherlock Holmes
is nothing at all like him.

1061
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:01,040
How would you describe me, John?

1062
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:04,920
Resourceful? Dynamic? Enigmatic?
Late?

1063
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,480
That's a semi-automatic.
If you fire it,

1064
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,320
the bullet will travel at
over 1,000 metres per second.

1065
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:10,840
Well?

1066
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,200
Well...
THUMP

1067
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,400
..the radius curvature of these
walls is nearly four metres.

1068
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,680
If you miss,
the bullet will ricochet.

1069
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,360
Could hit anyone.

1070
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:21,280
Might even bounce off the tunnel
and hit you.

1071
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,840
WHOOSH
THUMP

1072
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,280
GROANS

1073
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:36,080
FOOTSTEPS RECEDE

1074
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,920
It's all right.

1075
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,080
GRUNTS

1076
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,400
You're going to be all right.
It's over now.

1077
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,000
Don't worry.

1078
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,040
Next date won't be like this.

1079
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,480
We'll just slip off. No need
to mention us in your report.

1080
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:17,600
Mr Holmes... I have high hopes
for you, Inspector.

1081
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,920
A glittering career.

1082
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,960
I go where you point me.

1083
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,480
Exactly.

1084
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,000
POURING LIQUID

1085
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,680
WATSON: Ta.

1086
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:36,440
So, nine million. Million.

1087
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:41,800
Million, yes. Nine million for
Jade pin dragon den black tramway.

1088
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,280
An instruction
to all their London operatives.

1089
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,960
A message.
What they were trying to reclaim.

1090
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,800
What, a jade pin?
Worth 

1091
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,120
Bring it to the Tramway,
their London hideout.

1092
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,720
Hang on. A hairpin worth 

1093
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,960
Apparently. Why so much?

1094
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:58,120
Depends who owned it.

1095
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,080
Two operatives based in London.

1096
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,960
They travel over to Dalian
to smuggle those vases.

1097
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,320
One of them helps himself
to something, a little hairpin.

1098
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,800
Worth 
Eddie Van Coon was the thief,

1099
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,800
he stole the treasure
when he was in China.

1100
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,480
How do you know it was Van Coon,
not Lukis?

1101
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,560
Even the killer didn't know that.
Because of the soap.

1102
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,560
PHONE RINGS

1103
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,080
Amanda?
HOLMES: He brought you a present.

1104
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,560
Oh, hello.

1105
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,240
A little gift
when he came back from China.

1106
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:44,640
How do you know that?
You weren't just his PA, were you?

1107
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:46,240
Someone's been gossiping.

1108
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:48,080
No. Then I don't understand why...

1109
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,040
Scented hand soap in his apartment.

1110
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:53,480
300ml of it. Bottle almost finished.

1111
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:58,480
Sorry...? I don't think Eddie
Van Coon was the type of chap
to buy himself hand soap,

1112
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,600
not unless he had
a lady coming over.

1113
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,200
And it's the same brand as that
hand cream there on your desk.

1114
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:08,840
Look, it wasn't serious between us.

1115
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:13,440
It was over in a flash,
it couldn't last. He was my boss.

1116
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,040
What happened? Why did you end it?

1117
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,040
I thought he didn't appreciate me.

1118
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,840
Took me for granted.

1119
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,160
Stood me up once too often.

1120
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:29,960
We'd plan to go away for the weekend,
and then he'd just leave.

1121
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:32,720
Fly off to China
at a moment's notice.

1122
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:34,960
And he brought you a present
from abroad to say sorry.

1123
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,680
Can I just have a look at it?

1124
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,640
He really climbed up
onto the balcony?

1125
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:51,720
Nail a plank across the window
and all your problems are over.

1126
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,640
Thanks.

1127
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:59,080
He said he bought it
in a street market.

1128
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:02,000
Oh, I don't think that's true.
I think he pinched it.

1129
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,520
Yeah, that's Eddie.

1130
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,960
Didn't know its value,
just thought it would suit you.

1131
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:08,880
Oh? What's it worth?

1132
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:13,080


1133
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,320
Oh, my God.

1134
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,880
Oh, my God!

1135
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:23,000
Nine million?!

1136
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,680
Over 1,000 years old

1137
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,840
and it's sitting on her bedside table
every night.

1138
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,880
He didn't know its value. Didn't
know why they were chasing him.

1139
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:47,120
Should've just got her a lucky cat.

1140
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,520
You mind, don't you? What?

1141
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,480
That she escaped. General Shan.

1142
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,440
It's not enough
that we got her two henchmen.

1143
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,240
Must be a vast network, John.

1144
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,000
Thousands of operatives.

1145
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,520
You and I,
we barely scratched the surface.

1146
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,640
You cracked the code though,
Sherlock.

1147
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:09,480
And maybe Dimmock can track down
all of them now he knows it.

1148
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:13,920
No. No, I crack this code,

1149
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,000
all the smugglers have to do
is pick up another book.

1150
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,960
SIREN BLARES

1151
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:46,080
Without you...

1152
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:49,080
without your assistance,

1153
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:52,360
we would not have found
passage into London.

1154
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,800
You have my thanks.

1155
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,640
We did not anticipate...

1156
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,240
We did not know this man would come.

1157
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,760
This Sherlock Holmes.

1158
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:26,840
And now your safety is compromised.

1159
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:39,240
I will not reveal your identity.

1160
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:49,340

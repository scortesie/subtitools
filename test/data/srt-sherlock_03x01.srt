Its a trick.

Just a magic trick.

No. All right, stop it now.

Right the way down, right the way

No, no, no, no, its obvious.

Thats how he did it.
Its obvious.

Derren Brown?! Let it
go, Sherlocke dead.

33

But is he?

34
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,459
There was a body, it was him.

35

It was definitely him,
Molly Hooper laid him out.

No, shes lying.

37

It was Jim Moriartys
body with a mask on.

38
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,619
A mask?

39

A bungee rope, a
mask, Derren Brown.

Two years and the theories
keep getting more stupid.

got for me today?

Well, you know the paving
slabs in that whole area,

43
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,899
even the exact ones
that he landed on,

that Sherlock that was a
fraud, you and Donovan.

You did this and it killed
him and hes staying dead.

you have enough stupid theories,

wont bring him back.

Ive kept a weather eye
on him, of course.

168
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,659
We havent been in touch
at all to... prepare him.

No.

170
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,619
Well, well have to
get rid of that.

171
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,819
"We?" He looks ancient.

172
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,420
I cant be seen to be wandering
around with an old man.

173

No, I know.

So why now? What
changed your mind?

178
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,139
Well, Ive got some news.

Oh, God, is it serious?

What? No, no, Im not ill.

182
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,299
...moving on.

183
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,020
Youre emigrating?

184
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,300
Nope. Er, no, Ive er...

185
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,819
...I have met someone.

186
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,779
Oh! Ah, lovely.

187
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,619
Yeah. Were getting married.
Well, Im going to ask, anyway.

188
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,060
So soon after Sherlock?

189
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,500
Hmm, well, yes.

190
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,179
What's his name?

191
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,459
Its a woman.

192
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,940
A woman?! Yes, of
course its a woman.

193
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,699
You really have moved on, havent
you? Mrs. Hudson, how many times?

194
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,019
Sherlock was not my boyfriend!

You think so?

been two years.

Hes got on with his life.

Wheres he going to be tonight? How
would I know? You always know.

He has a dinner reservation
in the Marylebone Road.

Allow me to take it for you.

bottle of champagne. A good one.

Hmm, well, these are all

230
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,139
excellent vintages, sir.

00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,099
Well, you cannot
possibly go wrong,

recommendation... Hmm?

This last one on the list
is a favourite of mine.

like a face from the past.

Great. I'll have
that one please.

the quality of surprise!

endeavouring to, sir.

No. Youre dead.

00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,300
...you were dead.

one question, just let
me ask one question.

to keep that?

MUSIC: "Donde Estas,
Yolanda?" by Pink Martini

305
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,459
I calculated that there
were 13 possibilities

306
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,619
once ID invited
Moriarty onto the roof.

307
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,979
I wanted to avoid dying,
if at all possible.

308
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,739
The first scenario involved hurling myself
into a parked van filled with washing bags.

309
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,299
Impossible, the angle was too steep.
Secondly, a system of Japanese wrestling...

You know, for a genius, you
can be remarkably thick.

311
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,539
What? I don't care how
you faked it, Sherlock.

312
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,379
I want to know why.

313
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,660
Why? Because Moriarty
had to be stopped.

314
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,099
Oh.

315
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,140

316
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,219
I see. Yes. Why?

317
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,099
Thats a little more
difficult to explain.

318

brothers plan?

needed a confidante.

00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,539
A couple of others. It was a very
elaborate plan, it had to be.

The next of the 13
possibilities was... Who else?

00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,940
Who else knew?

Who?! Molly.

OK.

Hmm, no, she doesn't.

Im sorry, Im sorry,

I didn't know how to tell you...

Right, no, no, this is charming.
Ive really missed this(!)

346
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,739
One word, Sherlock, that is
all I would have needed!

347
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,220
One word to let me know
that you were alive!

Ive nearly been in contact so
many times, but... John SCOFFS

I worried that, you know, you might
say something indiscreet. What?

350
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,699
You know, let the cat out of
the bag. So this is my fault!

351
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,099
Oh, God! Why am I the only one
who thinks that this is wrong?!

352
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,219
The only one reacting
like a human being!

353
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,019
Over-reacting. Over-reacting!

354
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,299
John! Over-reacting! So you fake
your own death and you waltz in here

355
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,179
large as bloody life! Shh. But Im not
meant to have a problem with it,

356
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,739
cos Sherlock Holmes thinks its
a perfectly OK thing to do!

357
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,179
Shut up! I don't want everyone
knowing Im still alive!

358

Oh, so its still a secret, is
it?! Yes, its still a secret!

isnt that what youre
supposed to do?

368

Gosh, you don't know anything
about human nature, do you?

Hmm, nature? No.

organisation is planning an attack...

Thats what secret terrorist organisations
do, isnt it? Its their version of golf.

tell us that. Oh, well,

perhaps he shouldn't have done. He was
obviously just trying to show off.

No, Mycroft, but you have to
trust me. I'll find the answer.

Im the smart one."

I am the smart one.

I used to think I was an idiot.

00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,619
Both of us thought you
were an idiot, Sherlock.

until we met other children.

Oh, yes, that was a mistake.
Ghastly. What were they thinking of?

476
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,899
Probably something about
trying to make friends.

477
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,619
Oh, yes. Friends.

478
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,819
Of course, you go in for
that sort of thing now.

And you don't? Ever?

480
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,299
If you seem slow
to me, Sherlock,

481
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,899
can you imagine what
real people are like?

482

484
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,619
So? Oh, I don't know,

485
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,299
I thought perhaps you might
have found yourself a...

the subject, now.

487
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,859
Rest assured, Mycroft,

00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,139
whatever this underground
network of yours is up to,

489
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,459
the secret will reside in something
seemingly insignificant or bizarre.

490
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,059
Ooh-ooh. Speaking of which...

491
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,939
I cant believe it. I
just cant believe it!

Oh, isnt it wonderful,
Mr. Holmes?

I can barely contain myself(!)
Oh, he really can, you know.

495
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,860
Hes secretly pleased to see
you, underneath all that.

496
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,939
Sorry, which of us?

497

Both of you.

Lets play something different.

499
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,779
Why are we playing games?!

500

been raised to critical,

out, what do you reckon?

I always win. Which is
why you cant resist.

508
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,659
I find nothing irresistible in the
hat of a well-travelled anxious,

509
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,380
sentimental, unfit creature of
habit with appalling halitosis.

510
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,659
Damn. Isolated too,
don't you think?

511
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,939
Why would he be isolated?

512
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,099
"He?" Obviously. Why?
Size of the hat?

513
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,699
Dont be silly. Some women
have large heads too.

514
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,459
No, hes recently
had his hair cut,

515
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:05,019
you can see the little hairs adhering to
the perspiration stains on the inside.

516
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,339
Some women have short hair too.

517
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,460
Balance of probability. Not
that youve ever spoken

518
00:35:09,461 --> 00:35:11,579
to a woman with short hair,
or, you know, a woman.

519
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,419
Stains show hes out of condition.
Hes sentimental cos the hat

520
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,899
has been repaired, three, four...
Five times. Very neatly.

521
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,940
The cost of the repairs
exceeds that of the hat,

522
00:35:18,941 --> 00:35:20,979
hes mawkishly attached to it.
More than that.

523
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,220
One or two patches would
indicate sentimentality.

524
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,459
Fives obsessive behaviour.
Obsessive compulsive.

525
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,859
Hardly. Your client
left it behind.

526
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,099
What sort of an obsessive
compulsive would do that?

527
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,419
The earlier patches are
extensively sun bleached,

528
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,859
so hes worn it abroad, in Peru.

529
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,139
Peru? This is a chullo.

530
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,659
The classic headgear of
Andes, its made of alpaca.

531
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,339
No. No? Icelandic sheep wool.
Similar, but very distinctive,

532
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,139
if you know what youre looking for.
Ive written a blog on the varying

533

tensile strengths of
different natural fibres.

534
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,939
Im sure theres a
crying need for that(!)

535
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,179
You said he was anxious? The bobble on
the left side has been badly chewed,

536
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,699
which shows hes a man of a
nervous disposition, but...

537
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,099
But also a creature of habit,

538
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,659
cos he hasnt chewed the bobble
on the right. Precisely.

539
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,540
A sniff of the offending
bobble tells us all

540
00:35:57,541 --> 00:35:59,419
we need to know about the
state of his breath.

541
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,859
Brilliant! Elementary.

542
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,979
But youve missed his isolation.

543
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,579
I don't see it.

544
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,819

Tell me!

547
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,699
Well, anybody who wears
a hat as stupid as this

548
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,179
isnt in the habit of hanging
around other people, is he?

549
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,859
Not at all. Maybe he just
doesn't mind being different.

550
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,180
He doesn't necessarily
have to be isolated.

551
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,700
Exactly.

552
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,620
Im sorry?

553
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,579

Why would he mind?

The corpse is, is
six months old.

672
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,099
Its dressed in a shoddy
Victorian outfit from a museum.

673
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,219
Its been displayed on a
dummy for many years,

674
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,579
in a case facing South-east, judging
from the fading of the fabric.

675
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:39,859
It was sold off in a fire
damage sale a week ago.

676
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,019
So the whole thing was a fake?

Yes.

about, Mr. Shilcott?

Sorry. Do go on.

689
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,019
I like trains.

690
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,699
Yes... I work on the Tube, on the
District Line, and part of my job

691
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,299
is to wipe the security footage
after its been cleared.

692
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:33,220
I was just whizzing through and I
found something a bit bizarre.

693
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,699
Now, this was a week ago.

694
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,299
The last train on the Friday
night, Westminster Station.

695
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,579
Now, this man gets
into the last car.

696
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,659
Car? Theyre cars,
not carriages.

697
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,499
Its a legacy of the early American
involvement in the Tube system.

698
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,939
He said he liked trains.

699
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,619
And the next stop, St
James' Park Station.

700
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,100
And...

701
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,899
I thought youd like it.

702
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,020
He gets into the last car at
Westminster. The only passenger.

703
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,620
And the car is empty at
St James' Park Station.

704
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,619
Explain that, Mr. Holmes.

705
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:23,259
Couldnt he have just jumped off? Theres a
safety mechanism that prevents the doors

706
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,739
from opening in transit.
But theres something else,

707
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,019
the driver of that train
hasnt been to work since.

708
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:32,099
According to his flatmate, hes on
holiday. Came into some money.

709
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,500
Bought off?

710
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,139
Hmm?

711
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,019
So if the driver of the
train was in on it,

712
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,539
then the passenger did get off.

713
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,620
Theres nowhere he could go.
Its a straight run

714
00:45:41,621 --> 00:45:43,699
on the District Line
between the two stations.

715
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,219
Theres no side tunnels,
no maintenance tunnels.

716
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,860

722

The journey between those stations
usually takes five minutes

723
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,819
and that one took ten. Ten minutes to
get from Westminster to St James' Park.

724

806
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,659
Get up, John!

807
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,379
John! John?!

808
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,619
Help!

809
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,220
John!

810
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:28,939
John! John!

811
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,820
Hey, John.

812
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:47,859
ELDERLY LADY: Which wasnt the way
ID put it at all. Silly woman.

813
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:51,299
Anyway, it was then that I
first noticed it was missing.

814
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,139
I said, "Have you checked
down the back of the sofa?"

815
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:57,219
Hes always losing things down the
back of the sofa, arent you, dear?

816
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,339
Afraid so.

817
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:01,819
Oh, keys, small
change, sweeties.

818
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,299
Especially his glasses. Glasses.

819
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,659
Blooming things. I said,
"Why don't you get a chain,"

820
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,099
"wear them round your neck?"

821
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,939
And he says, "What, like Larry
Grayson!" Larry Grayson.

822
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:14,139
So did you find it eventually,
your lottery ticket?

823
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,299
Well, yes, thank goodness.

824
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,459
We caught the coach
on time after all.

825
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:21,459
We managed to see St
Pauls, the Tower,

826
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:24,099
but they werent letting
anyone into Parliament.

827
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,699
Some big debate going on.

00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:30,339

no, they were just leaving.

830
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,819
No, oh, were we? Yes. No,
no, if youve got a case...

831
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,660
No, not a case. Yeah, go.
Were here till

832
00:56:34,661 --> 00:56:36,499
Saturday, remember. Yes,
wonderful. Just get out!

833
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,699
Yes, well, give us a ring.
Very nice, yes, good. Get out!

834
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,699
I cant tell you how
glad we are, Sherlock.

835
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,819
All that time people
thinking the worst.

836
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,739
Were just so pleased
its all over.

837
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,379
Ring up more often, wont you?

838
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,459
Mm-hm. She worries.

839
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,660
Promise?

00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,099
Promise.

843
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,099
Sorry about that. No, its fine.

00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,259

845
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,179
Just my parents.

Your parents? In
town for a few days.

847
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,019
Your parents? Mycroft promised to
take them to a matinee of Les Mis.

848
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,779
Tried to talk me into doing it.

849
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:11,179
Those were your parents? Yes.

850
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,540
Well...

00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,979
...that is not what I...

852
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,779
What?

853
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,900
I mean, they're just so...

854
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,419
...ordinary.

855

Its a cross I have to bear.

856
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,900
Did they know too?

857
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,980
Hmm? That you spent the last two
years playing hide and seek?

858
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,979
Maybe. Ah, so thats why
they werent at the funeral!

859
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,980
Sorry, sorry again. Hmm.

860
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,860
Sorry.

861
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:56,339
So youve shaved it off then?

862
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,739
Yeah. Wasnt working for me.

863
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,819
Yeah, Im glad. You
didn't like it?

864
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,620
No, I prefer my
doctors clean-shaven.

865
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,940
Thats not a sentence
you hear every day.

866
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:11,899
How are you feeling?

867
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,459
Yeah, not bad. Bit smoked.

868
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,540
Right.

869
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,340
Last night, who did that?

870
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,579
And why did they target me?

871
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:25,859
I don't know.

872
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,739
Is it someone trying to
get to you through me?

873
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:30,539
Is it something to do with this
terrorist thing you talked about?

874
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,339
I don't know, I cant see the
pattern. Its too nebulous.

875
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,580
Why would an agent give his
life to tell us something

876
00:58:35,581 --> 00:58:37,819
incredibly insignificant?
Thats what's strange.

877
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,539
Give his life?
According to Mycroft.

878
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,819
Theres an underground network planning
an attack on London, thats all we know.

(HE SNIFFS)

These are my rats, John. Rats?

881
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,859
My markers, agents, lowlifes.
People who might find themselves

882
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,540
arrested or their diplomatic
immunity suddenly rescinded.

883
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:57,379
If one of them starts acting
suspiciously, we know somethings up.

884
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,979
Five of them are behaving perfectly
normally, but the sixth...

885
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,099
I know him, don't I?

886
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:04,259
Lord Moran, Peer of the Realm.
Minister for Overseas Development.

Pillar of the Establishment.
Yes.

888
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,899
Hes been working for
North Korea since 1996.

889
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,819
What? Hes the big
rat, rat number one.

890
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:14,660
Hes just done something
very suspicious indeed.

891
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,979
Yeah, thats odd.

892
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,779
Theres nowhere he
could have got off?

893
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:25,939
Not according to the maps.

894
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:28,379
Theres something, something,
something Im missing.

895
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,419
Something staring
me in the face.

(PHONE BEEPS)

897
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,500
Any idea who they are,
this underground network?

898
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,859
Intelligence must have a list
of the most obvious ones.

899
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,419
Our rats just come
out of his den.

900
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,619
Al-Qaeda? The IRA have been
getting restless again,

901
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,619
maybe they're going to make an
appearance... Yes, yes, yes, yes!

902
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:48,139
Ive been an idiot,
a blind idiot!

903
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,539
What? Oh, thats good.
That could be brilliant!

904
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,859
What are you on about? Mycrofts
intelligence is not nebulous at all,

905
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,579
its specific,
incredibly specific.

906
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:56,859
What do you mean?

907
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,619
Its not an underground network,
John, its an Underground network!

908
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,459
Right.

909
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:04,059
What? Sometimes a deception is
so audacious, so outrageous

910
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:07,259
that you cant see it even when its
staring you in the face. Look,

911
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,379
seven carriages leave
Westminster. Mm.

912
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:13,260
And only six carriages
arrive at St James' Park.

913
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,379
Ah, but thats, I mean,
its impossible.

914
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,579
Moran didn't disappear. The
entire tube compartment did.

915
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,819
The driver must have diverted the train
and then detached the last carriage.

916
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:27,659
Detached it where? You said there
was nothing between those stations.

917
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,939
Not on the maps, but once you
eliminate the other factors,

918
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:33,499
the remaining thing must be the truth. That
carriage vanished, so it must be somewhere.

919
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,019
But why, though?

920
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:36,579
Why detach it in
the first place?

921
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,539
It vanishes between St
James' Park and Westminster.

922
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,259
Lord Moran vanishes.

923
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:45,260
Youre kidnapped and nearly burnt
to death at a fireworks party.

924
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,379
What's the date,
John, todays date?

925
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,899
Hmm? November the...

926
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,020
Oh, God!

927
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,699
Lord Moran, hes a
Peer of the Realm.

928
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,019
Normally hed sit in the House.

929
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:01,900
Tonight, theres an all-night sitting to
vote on the new anti-terrorism bill.

930
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,499
But he wont be
there, not tonight.

931
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,499
Not the 5th November.

932
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,219
"Remember, remember..."

"Gunpowder, treason and plot!"

934
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,539
Theres nothing down there,
Mr. Holmes, I told you.

935
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,179
No sidings, no ghost stations.

936
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,619
There has to be, check again.

937
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:20,899
This whole area is a big
mess of old and new stuff.

938
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,179
Charing Cross is made up
of bits of older stations,

939
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,699
like Trafalgar Square, Strand.

940
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,899
No, its none of those,
weve accounted for those.

941
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,019
St Margaret Street, Bridge Street,
Sumatra Road, Parliament Street...

942
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,099
Hang on, hang on, Sumatra Road?

943
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:35,539
You mentioned Sumatra Road,
Mr. Holmes? There is something,

944
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:37,059
I knew it rang a bell! Yes.

945
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,619
There was a station down there.

946
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:40,379
Well, why isnt it on the maps?

947
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,899
Because it was closed before
it ever opened.' What?

948
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:46,379
They built the platforms, even the
staircases, but it all got tied up

949
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:49,540
in legal disputes and so they never
built the station on the surface.

950
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,819
Its right underneath the
Palace of Westminster.

951
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,539
So what's down there, a bomb?

952
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,980
Oh.

953
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:01,179
With many commentators saying

954
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,859
the vote on the Terrorism Bill
will be too close to call,

955
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:06,899
MPs are now making their way
into the Chamber for what

956
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:11,659
the Government is calling "the most
important vote of this Parliament."

957
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:12,899
Over now to our...

958
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,939
What freedoms exactly
are we protecting

959
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,099
if we start spying
on our own people?

960
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,900
This is a Orwellian measure
on a scale unprecedented...

961
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:40,899
Theres a bomb, then? The tube

Sherlock, this isnt a game, they
need to evacuate Parliament.

965
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:53,299
Theyll get in the way, they always
do. This is cleaner, more efficient.

966
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,420
And illegal? A bit.

967
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:12,819
What are you doing?

968
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:14,100
Coming.

Hang on, Sherlock...? What?
Thats, isnt it live?

975

Perfectly safe as long as we
avoid touching the rails.

976
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:59,259
Of course, yeah, avoid
the rails. Great!

977

This way.

Its empty. Theres nothing.

Isnt there?

985
01:06:58,340 --> 01:06:59,739
This is the bomb.

What?

987
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:08,340
Its not carrying explosives, the
whole compartment is the bomb.

There may not be
time for that now.

991
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:04,940
So what do we do?

992
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:09,179
I have no idea.

993
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:12,579
Well, think of something. Why
do you think I know what to do?

994
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:15,179
Cos youre Sherlock Holmes,
youre as clever as it gets.

995

It doesn't mean I know how
to diffuse a giant bomb!

disposal, Im a bloody doctor!

keep reminding us all!

998

Cant... Cant we rip the
timer off, or something?

999
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:28,380

never call the police?!

Well, its no use now.

the bomb off?!

1009

it difficult, this sort of stuff.

man that I have ever known.

Yes, of course I forgive you.

1054
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:06,539
The criminal network
Moriarty headed was vast.

1055
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:09,739
Its roots were everywhere, like a
cancer, so we came up with a plan.

1056
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:12,899
Mycroft fed Moriarty
information about me.

1057
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:16,619
Moriarty, in turn,
gave us hints,

1058
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:19,139
just hints as to the
extent of his web.

1059
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:23,099
We let him go, because it was
important to let him believe

1060
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,659
he had the upper hand.

1061
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:27,459
And then, I sat back
and watched Moriarty

1062
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:30,099
destroy my reputation,
bit by bit.

1063
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:33,139
I had to make him
believe hed beaten me,

1064
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,899
utterly defeated me, and
then hed show his hand.

1065
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:39,779
There were 13 likely scenarios
once we were up on that roof.

1066
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:43,459
Each of them were rigorously
worked out and given a code name.

1067
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:46,219
It wasnt just my reputation
that Moriarty needed to bury.

1068
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:47,739
I had to die.

1069
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:49,539
Sherlock!

1070
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:52,899
You can have me arrested,
you can torture me,

1071
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:56,019
you can do anything
you like with me,

1072
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:59,659
but nothings going to prevent
them from pulling the trigger.

1073
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:03,659
Your only three friends in the
world will die, unless...

1074
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:06,540
Unless I kill myself and
complete your story.

1075
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:10,459
Youve got to admit
thats sexier.

1076
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:13,099
But the one thing I didn't
anticipate was just how far.

1077
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:15,939
Moriarty was prepared to go.
I suppose that was obvious,

1078
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:18,379
given our first meeting
at the swimming pool.

1079
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:19,579
His death wish.

1080
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:20,699
Argh!

1081
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:21,700
(GUNSHOT)

1082
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:28,819
I knew I didn't have long.

1083
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:31,660
I contacted my brother,
set the wheels in motion.

1084
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:35,820
And then everyone got to work.

1085
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:21,540
Its a trick.

1086
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:24,380
Its just a magic trick.

1087
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:27,579
All right, stop it now.

1088
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,500
Now, stay exactly
where you are.

1089
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:32,460
Dont move!

1090
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:36,020
All right.

1091
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:41,300
Keep your eyes fixed on me.

1092
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:44,140
Please, will you do this for me?

1093
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:52,099
It was vital that John
stayed just where ID put him

1094
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:55,819
and that way his view was blocked
by the ambulance station.

1095
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:57,380
Sherlock!

1096
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:10,299
I needed to hit the air-bag,

1097
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,219
which I did.

1098
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:13,899
Speed was Paramount.

1099
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:16,019
The air-bag needed to
be got out of the way

1100
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:18,539
just as John cleared
the station.

1101
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:21,019
But we needed him to see a body.

1102
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,539
Thats where Molly came in.

1103
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:27,460
Like figures on a weather clock, we
went one way, John went the other.

1104
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:31,700
Then, our well-timed cyclist...

1105
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:35,899
...put John briefly
out of action,

1106
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:39,540
giving me time to switch places
with the corpse on the pavement.

1107
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,660
The rest was just
window dressing.

1108
01:15:55,820 --> 01:16:00,739
And one final touch, a squash
ball under the armpit.

1109
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:04,220
Apply enough pressure and it
momentarily cuts off the pulse.

1110
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:13,179
Let me come through, please!

1111
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:15,739
Its all right...
No, hes my friend.

1112
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:18,019
Its all right. No,
hes my friend.

1113
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:20,580
Its all right, its all right...
Hes my friend, please.

1114
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:33,579
Everything was anticipated,
every eventuality allowed for.

1115
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:36,259
It worked perfectly.

1116
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:40,259
Molly. Molly Hooper?
She was in on it?

1117
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:43,099
Yes. You remember the little girl
who was abducted by Moriarty?

1118
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,099
(SHE SCREAMS)

1119
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,379
Get out!

1120
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:48,219
You assumed she reacted like that

But I deduced Moriarty must
have found someone who looked

1122
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:54,379
very like me to plant suspicion,
and that that man, whoever he was,

1123
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:57,379
had to be got out of the way as
soon as his usefulness ended.

1124
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:59,659
That meant there was a corpse

Clever.

1127

Molly found the body,
faked the records
